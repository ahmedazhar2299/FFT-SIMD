# FFT-SIMD

This repository provides an implementation of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient polynomial multiplication. It demonstrates how to construct large integer convolutions using complex FFT (floating-point). The project showcases techniques for handling large input sizes and benchmarking performance on modern CPUs.
