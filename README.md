# FFT-SIMD

This repository provides an implementation of **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** and **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)** for efficient polynomial multiplication. It demonstrates how to construct large integer convolutions using both complex FFT (floating-point) and modular NTT (finite field arithmetic). The project showcases techniques for handling large input sizes, working with NTT-friendly primes (such as **998244353**), and benchmarking performance on modern CPUs.

In addition, the implementation leverages **SIMD vectorization**:
- **AVX2 / AVX-512** on Intel/AMD  
- **NEON** on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)  

to accelerate butterfly operations inside FFT/NTT. By parallelizing modular arithmetic across multiple data lanes, the SIMD version achieves more than **4Ã— speedup** compared to the scalar baseline.  

This makes the project suitable for high-performance applications in:
- Cryptography  
- Error-correcting codes  
- Signal and image processing  
- Large-scale polynomial computations
